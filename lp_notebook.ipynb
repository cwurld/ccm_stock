    "# Stock Trading Strategy Based on Leading Indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't know much about stock trading strategies. The reason I created this notebook is to play around with Python data science tools and the stock market has lots of data. Also I wanted something \"actionable\" if the idea showed promise.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the reasons I have not looked into stock trading strategies is I believe in the [\"Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)\"](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficientmarkethypothesis.asp). This basically says that you can't make money off well known trading strategies because everyone uses them, which causes the price to change, and erases the potential gains. By the time Jim Cramer is talking about it, you are too late. Or worse you are about to be the victim of a pump-and-dump operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then again, as a programmer, I have always been fascinated by the [\"combinatorial explosion\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_explosion); as the number of things there is to combine grows, the number of possible combinations grows exponentially. In the stock market, its plausible that some combination of financial measures could predict short-term changes in a given stock's price. Since there are so many possible combinations of financial measures, it seems possible to find one that no one else knows about; thus avoiding the EMH.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, when searching such a large space of possible measures, it is likely that many of these will be actually be the results of over-fitting noise. In those cases, future stock prices will not be correlated with the predictors. On average, the return of the strategy will be 0, minus the trading costs. For now, we will assume the trading costs are 0, so the costs of over-fitting will just be the opportunity cost of not investing in a better performing strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Strategy\n",
    "The goal is to predict short-term price spikes in a target stock based on patterns in other finacial measures. To do this, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. pick a target stock\n",
    "2. find all the price spikes in the recent historical data of that stock\n",
    "3. look for patterns in the short-term historical data of many other financial measures, right before the spikes in the target\n",
    "4. combine them to make a predictor for that stock\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Financial Measures\n",
    "Their are many possible financial measures; gold, oil, sentiment analysis of Reddit, ... To make things easy for now, we will just use historical stock data that can be obtained from Yahoo, for free. More specifically, the NASDAQ.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spikes\n",
    "We want the spikes to be something we can make money off of. It seems like it will be easier to predict short-term changes. We will try this pattern: look for a sequence of 3 prices that are monotonically increasing and have a gain that is greater than 3% (e.g. p[t+2] > p[t+1] > p[t] and (p[t+2] - p[t])/p[t] > 0.03).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Estimating the Predictor Function\n",
    "We will assume that in some short time window, immediately before each spike<sub>i</sub>, the historical data for a single stock will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$h_{i}(t) = f(t)(a_{i}p(t) + r(t))$\n",
    "\n",
    "where f(t) is the signal in the predictor stock that would have happened if the economic event that caused the spike in the target did not happen, p(t) is the predictor function for that stock, a<sub>i</sub> is a scalar and r(t) is random noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "Extracting p(t) is only possible with some simplifying assumptions. The perennial favorite is make f(t) piecewise linear by doing a Taylor series expansion. But even linear is kind of messy. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the year after (covid) April 2020, there was an almost unprecedented bull market. During that time, the S&P 500 gained about 12%, giving a weekly gain of about 0.2%. Looks like we can ignore the linear term. Lets just say that f(t) is a constant before each spike.\n",
    "\n",
    "$h_{i}(t) = b_{i}(a_{i}p(t) + r(t))$\n",
    "\n",
    "Averaging $h_{i}(t)$ would give the shape of p(t), but it would excessively weight events that happened when the predictor stock price was high. So we will divide each $h_{i}(t)$ by the average value during the time period before the spike.\n",

    "If we wanted to continue with this strategy, then next step would be to find a way to pick the predictors and thresholds using the shortest time span possible. This could involve including a split just for that. Maybe 10 months for training, 3 months for dev and 3 months for test. Maybe interleave the splits.\n",

    "Another option would be to look at how the predictor function converges. The predictor function is made by averaging many snippets. If many of the snippets looked similar, then the average might be meaningful. Whereas if each snippet looked completely different, we would still get an average, but it would just be an average of noise.\n",
